The **MIM-104 Patriot** missile system is an advanced surface-to-air missile (SAM) system primarily designed for **air and missile defense**. While it does not have a traditional **self-protection system** like fighter aircraft (e.g., electronic countermeasures or flares), the **Patriot system** employs various defensive and redundancy measures to protect itself and ensure mission success.

## **1. Patriot Missile System Overview**
- **Role:** Air & missile defense (against aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles)
- **Manufacturer:** Raytheon Technologies
- **Guidance:** Radar-guided (Track-Via-Missile)
- **Launch Platform:** Mobile ground-based system

## **2. Self-Protection & Survivability Features**
Though the **MIM-104 Patriot** system itself does not have a built-in *self-defense missile* or *active jamming* system like some aircraft, it relies on **layered defense tactics and strategic deployment** to protect itself from attacks.

### **A. Mobile & Dispersed Deployment**
- Patriot units can **quickly relocate**, reducing vulnerability to preemptive strikes.
- Launchers are typically **spread out** over a large area, preventing a single attack from disabling the entire system.

### **B. Redundant Radar & Command Systems**
- The **AN/MPQ-65 radar** (upgraded from the AN/MPQ-53) provides **high-speed target tracking** and **low probability of intercept (LPI)** to reduce vulnerability to enemy electronic warfare.
- **Decentralized control:** Multiple fire units can **share tracking data**, so if one is taken out, others can still engage threats.

### **C. Electronic Warfare (EW) Resistance**
- **ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures):** Patriot radars can filter out **jamming and electronic interference**, preventing enemy EW attacks from blinding the system.
- **Frequency Agility:** The system can switch radar frequencies to avoid enemy jamming.

### **D. Close-In Defense (Layered Protection)**
- Patriot batteries are typically **protected by additional defense systems**, such as:
  - **Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) systems** (e.g., Phalanx CIWS adapted for land use)
  - **Short-range air defense (SHORAD) systems**, such as the **Avenger (Stinger missiles)** or **NASAMS (AMRAAM-based ground launchers)**
  - **Counter-drone systems** to neutralize UAVs that could target Patriot radars or launchers

### **E. Hardening Against Ballistic Missile Strikes**
- To counter long-range ballistic missile threats, Patriot batteries are **distributed and hardened**:
  - **Underground shelters for command units**
  - **Hardened radar sites with blast-resistant structures**
  - **Rapid redeployment tactics** after firing to avoid enemy counter-battery attacks

### **F. Decoy & Deception Strategies**
- Patriot units may use **inflatable decoys** or other deception tactics to mislead enemy reconnaissance.
- Some advanced military units deploy **false radar signatures** to trick enemy targeting systems.

## **3. Potential Future Upgrades for Self-Protection**
- **Active Protection Systems (APS):** There is research into integrating **hard-kill APS** (like Israelâ€™s **Trophy** or the U.S. **Iron Fist**) to shoot down incoming threats.
- **Directed Energy Weapons (DEW):** Laser or microwave-based defenses could be added to neutralize small threats like drones or loitering munitions.
- **Autonomous Counter-UAV Systems:** AI-powered **anti-drone systems** that automatically detect and neutralize UAV threats.

---

## **Conclusion**
The **MIM-104 Patriot** does not have a direct **self-protection missile system**, but it relies on **mobility, electronic countermeasures, redundancy, and layered defense strategies** to survive against threats. It is typically deployed with **additional short-range air defenses** and **electronic warfare capabilities** to enhance survivability.
